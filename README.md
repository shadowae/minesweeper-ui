# Minesweeper UI

A Minesweeper game UI built with React. This project renders a grid-based Minesweeper game where cells can be empty, display a number (indicating nearby mines), or contain a mine. The UI supports cell revealing on left click and flagging on right click, and is fully tested with Vitest and React Testing Library.

🎮 **[Play Live Demo](https://minesweeper-ui.netlify.app/)**

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Rendering:** Configure grid size and mine positions
- **Cell Interactions:** Left-click to reveal cells and right-click to flag/unflag cells
- **Game Over and Win Conditions:** Display explosion icons, confetti animation, and a modal for restarting the game
- **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive test suite using Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Responsive Layout:** Grid-based design that adjusts based on game configuration
